Dialogue:
    - Branching dialogue
        - Another abstraction - instead of a List of dialogue lines, Dialogue should hold a List of dialogue branches.
        - Branch 0 is the entry - "Hi, do you prefer cars or flowers?" Options "Cars". "Flowers"
            - Branch 1 would be cars "Which type of car?" Options "Miata". "Polo"
            - Branch 2 would be flowers "Which flower"? etc
        - Requires a minor rewrite, nothing too major until much dialogue is defined.
    - String abstraction
        - I know you (Kacper) want to be able to define all dialogue in the unity inspector...
        - But the correct pattern here is to abstract all that out into a separate file
        - I know its unlikely, but if we would ever need to tackle translation into other languages, this would be impossible without a major rewrite
            - If in a file, you just say if language=Mandarin, load strings-mandarin.json. If language=spanish... etc
        - Also with things like branching dialogue, or another change to the core dialogue system. Inspector values don't persist if we change it from a List of dialogue lines.
        - Therefore, this needs to be done... at some point. Not an immediate priority until things start looking like an actual game.

Shopping:
    - Shop menu
        - Shop inventory - should be the shopkeep NPC inventory? Or separate?
    - Buying
    - Selling

NPCs:
    - Movement
        - Define NPC paths. Passive movement when not interacting with the player. Basic for now.
    - NPC interactions with world - speak to other NPC's etc. 

Player:
    - Attacking - just fun. Break pots for rupees etc.

Input:
    - Refactor subscriptions such that an InputManager class handles all input.
        - Player controller, Menu manager, Dialogue Manager then all subscribe to events emitted from InputManager
        - It's not a super major concern but it would be cleaner. Stuff like Menu manager needing to sub to the playerworldactions.menuopen input is smelly - but doesn't impact performance or manageability (too much).
            - the alternative for this would have been the playercontroller handling menu open - which is even stinkier imo.
        - It may become a bigger concern when we do shops, battles, etc. Not too sure. Vibe it out.
