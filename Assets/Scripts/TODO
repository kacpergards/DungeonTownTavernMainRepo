Dialogue:
    - Unify dialogue and inventory/menus into menuManager - maybe?
    - NPC interact behaviour (e.g. entering dialogue) should be handled on the NPC - calling menu manager to show dialogue etc
        - Define npc dialogue & specific behaviours on the NPC, generic behaviours (showing dialogue, entering battle) on a Framework component
    - Better dialogue - smoother text, selecting dialogue options, etc.
        - Decide whether dialogue-initiated events should happen on the menu manager or somewhere else
            - Suggest: Menu manager handles showing, closing, shops, state management of menus. Game controller handles events - battle, scene transitions

Shopping:
    - Shop menu
        - Shop inventory - should be the shopkeep NPC inventory? Or separate?
    - Buying
    - Selling

NPCs:
    - Movement
        - Define NPC paths. Passive movement when not interacting with the player. Basic for now.
    - NPC interactions with world - speak to other NPC's etc. 

Player:
    - More satisfying movement. Clean and responsive. Jumping.
    - Attacking - just fun. Break pots for rupees etc.
